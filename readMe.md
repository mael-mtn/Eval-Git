cd root/your_projects_repository
```



```bash
mkdir name_of_your_project
```



## Link it to your GitHub IDs



```bash
git config --global user.name your_user_name
```



```bash
git config --global user.email your_user_mail
```



## Check the IDs



```bash
git config --list
```



## Initialize git



```bash
git init
```



## Create the ReadMe.md file



```bash
touch ReadMe.md
```



md means markdown



## Index the ReadMe.md file



```bash
git add ReadMe.md
```



## Stage the ReadMe.md file



```bash
git commit -m "Title_of_the_change"
```



## Link the repository to the URL



```bash
git  origin url_of_the_repo
```



## Send the project on the distant repository as master



```bash
git push -u origin master
```



## if you modified a file your need to add, then commit and finaly push your work to GitHub



```bash
git add name_of_the_file
```



```bash
